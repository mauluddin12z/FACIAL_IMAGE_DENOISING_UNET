# Facial Image Denoising using U-Net

This project focuses on denoising facial images using the U-Net architecture. The U-Net model is trained to remove noise from facial images, enhancing their quality and clarity.

## Introduction

Denoising facial images is important for various applications, including image processing and computer vision tasks. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net model, for facial image denoising.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The dataset used contains noisy facial images as well as corresponding clean images for training the denoising model.

### Data Preprocessing

- Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- Image normalization and resizing are performed to prepare the data for training.

### Model Architecture

- **U-Net**: The U-Net architecture is utilized for image-to-image translation, specifically for denoising facial images. U-Net consists of an encoder-decoder network with skip connections to preserve spatial information.

### Training

- The U-Net model is trained on the noisy-clean image pairs using techniques like mean squared error (MSE) loss for optimization.

### Evaluation

- The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance in terms of noise reduction and image quality improvement.
